# csvToJson
This is simple command line converter that I made when learning Go.  
It converts .csv file to .json file in same directory where converter was run 

### Installation and usage
```
git clone https://github.com/mkujala/csvToJson.git  
INSTALL: go install  
USAGE: csv2json yourFile.csv  
```

There is still a lot of room for improvement.
